                        <h2>Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            The target audience I went for is parents and
                            teachers of kindergarten kids. For the game idea I
                            decided a quiz could be a fun way for kids to learn
                            and become more motivated about environmentalism.
                            So, the ultimate goal of my website is to convince
                            teacher and parents to get kids to play the climate
                            quiz.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The very first thing I did was set up a Trello to
                            ensure that I kept track of what my plan was and the
                            exact steps I needed to take. I wanted to have the
                            entire layout and look of the website figured out
                            before I started coding. In order to do that I ended
                            up creating not just wireframes for the mobile,
                            tablet and desktop versions, but also a style guide
                            and prototype, which can all be viewed on

                            I went for a mostly professional, trustworthy and
                            minimalist design. But the headings typeface is
                            childish, and the paragraph typeface soft, just to
                            convey that the website does still have the
                            kindergarten kids in mind. Of course, readability
                            was always prioritized.

                        <p>
                            For the header I decided that four separate button
                            links to each page would look best, and be easier to
                            move around for the different layouts. The desktop
                            layout has the navbar moved to the right side of the
                            page, not only in order to reduce white space on
                            wider screens, but also to push the main content
                            more to the left, which is better for English
                            speaking users that read from left to right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The NTNU logo is very large on mobile, but that is
                            because I want the layout to be very consistent,
                            which means the footer elements must have all the
                            same width.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the navbar I added a leaf icon to the current
                            page button, in order to not just rely on color to
                            inform the user which page they’re currently on,
                            because that could be problematic for color blind
                            users.

                        <p>
                            I’ve tried my best to keep the project well
                            organized, with an easy to navigate file structure.
                            All of the file types are separated into their own
                            folders, and only the assets have a sub-folder, in
                            order to separate the icons, images and typefaces.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>
                            All image files were converted to webp format and
                            compressed, which resulted in around 70% reduction
                            in file sizes. The pdf of the quiz cards has also
                            been compressed. The typefaces are in the project as
                            local files instead of being imported using the
                            Google Fonts CDN, in order to avoid network
                            requests. Typefaces have also been converted from
                            ttf to woff2 for smaller file sizes. I’ve also tried
                            my best to follow the DRY principle, to keep the
                            code clean, efficient and as eco-friendly as
                            possible.

                        <h2>Code</h2>
                        <p>
                            I debated putting the sidebar navigation in an
                            aside, but since it is not related to the page
                            content it didn’t seem appropriate. Ended up using
                            more media queries than I wanted to, because some
                            elements like the flip cards, navbar leaf and arrows
                            in the h2 banner on the front page required some
                            extra code for very small screen widths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used the same naming convention for all my classes
                            and ids. Tried to correctly use the article, section
                            and figure elements, to make the HTML more semantic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I gave the tabindex attribute a value of 0 to make
                            the cards focusable, and used the focus pseudo-class
                            for making the hover animations play when the
                            elements are focused. This makes the cards
                            accessible for people relying on keyboard navigation
                            and screen readers. Also used the title attribute on
                            some links to inform people with screen readers that
                            they open in a new window. Added descriptive alt
                            text to the article images.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Used Shorthand properties as much as possible in the
                            CSS. I tried to add some comments in CSS to organize
                            it into different layouts, but I admit that comment
                            is something that I need to get better at.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My impression during this project was that the very
                            simple layouts were easier to create using flex,
                            while grid seemed the most appropriate for the
                            footer since it had many elements and required a
                            more complex layout.
